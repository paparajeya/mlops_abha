  * `feat`: A new feature
  * `fix`: A bug fix
  * `docs`: Documentation changes
  * `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
  * `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  * `perf`: Performance improvements
  * `test`: Adding or correcting tests
  * `chore`: Maintenance tasks (build process, auxiliary tools, libraries)

* **`scope`** *(optional)*: Provides additional contextual information, typically the name of the affected module or component, enclosed in parentheses.

* **`description`**: A concise summary of the change, written in the imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix", "update").

* **`body`** *(optional)*: A more detailed explanation of the change, its rationale, and any relevant background information.

* **Use the imperative mood**: Write as if you're giving a command (e.g., "add feature", not "added feature").
* **Be concise**: Keep the subject line under 50 characters if possible.
* **Provide context**: Use the body to explain the "why" behind the change.
* **Consistent formatting**: Maintain a consistent structure to facilitate automated tools.
* **Review before committing**: Always review your commit message for clarity and completeness.
